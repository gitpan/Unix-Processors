Description

       print $procs->max_online, " CPUs at ", $procs->max_clock, " MHz\n";
       if ($procs->max_online != $procs->max_physical) {
           print "Hyperthreading between ",$procs->max_physical," physical CPUs.\n";
       }
       (my $FORMAT =   "%2s  %-8s     %4s    \n") =~ s/\s\s+/ /g;
       printf($FORMAT, "#", "STATE", "CLOCK",  "TYPE", );
       foreach my $proc (@{$procs->processors}) {
           printf ($FORMAT, $proc->id, $proc->state, $proc->clock, $proc->type);
